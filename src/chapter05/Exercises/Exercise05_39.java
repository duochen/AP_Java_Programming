/**
 * (Financial application: find the sales amount) You have just started a sales job in a
 * department store. Your pay consists of a base salary and a commission. The base salary
 * is $5,000. The scheme shown below is used to determine the commission rate.
 * Sales Amount          Commission Rate
 * $0.01–$5,000         6 percent
 * $5,000.01–$10,000    8 percent
 * $10,000.01 and above  10 percent
 * Note that this is a graduated rate. The rate for the first $5,000 is at 6%, the next
 * $5000 is at 8%, and the rest is at 10%. If your sales amounts to $25,000, the commission
 * is 5,000 * 6% + 5,000 * 8% + 15,000 * 10% = 2,200. Your goal is to
 * earn $30,000 a year. Write a program to find the minimum sales you have to generate
 * in order to make $30,000.
