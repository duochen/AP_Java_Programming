/**
 * (Statistics: compute deviation) Programming Exercise 5.45 computes the standard
 * deviation of numbers. This exercise uses a different but equivalent formula to
 * compute the standard deviation of n numbers.
 * To compute the standard deviation with this formula, you have to store the individual
 * numbers using an array, so they can be used after the mean is obtained.
 * Your program should contain the following methods:
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter 10numbers and displays the
 * mean and standard deviation,as presented in the following sample run:
 *
 * Enter 10 numbers: 1.9 2.5 3.7 2 1 6 3 4 5 2
 * The mean is 3.11
 * The standard deviation is 1.55738
