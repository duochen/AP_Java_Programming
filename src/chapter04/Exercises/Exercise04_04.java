/**
 * (Geometry: area of a hexagon) The area of a hexagon can be computed using the
 * following formula (s is the length of a side):
 * Area = (6 * s^2) / (4 * tan(PI/6))
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays
 * its area.
 *
 * Here is a sample run:
 * Enter the side: 5.5
 * The area of the hexagon is 78.59
