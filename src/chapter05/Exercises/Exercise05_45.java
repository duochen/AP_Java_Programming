/**
 * (Statistics: compute mean and standard deviation) In business applications, you
 * are often asked to compute the mean and standard deviation of data. The mean is
 * simply the average of the numbers. The standard deviation is a statistic that tells
 * you how tightly all the various data are clustered around the mean in a set of data.
 * For example, what is the average age of the students in a class? How close are the
 * ages? If all the students are the same age, the deviation is 0.
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter 10 numbers and displays the mean
 * and standard deviations of these numbers using the following formula:
 *
 * Here is a sample run:
 * Enter 10 numbers: 1 2 3 4.5 5.6 6 7 8 9 10
 * The mean is 5.61
 * The standard deviation is 2.99794
