/**
 * (Financial application: loan amortization schedule) The monthly payment for a given
 * loan pays the principal and the interest. The monthly interest is computed by multiplying
 * the monthly interest rate and the balance (the remaining principal). The principal
 * paid for the month is therefore the monthly payment minus the monthly interest.
 * Write a program that lets the user enter the loan amount, number of years, and interest
 * rate then displays the amortization schedule for the loan. Here is a sample run:
 *
 * Loan Amount: 10000
 * Number of Years: 1
 * Annual Interest Rate: 7
 *
 * Monthly Payment: 865.26
 * Total Payment: 10383.2
 *
 * Payment#	Interest	Principal	Balance
 * 1			58.33		806.93		9193.07
 * 2			53.62		811.64		8381.43
 * 3			48.89		816.37		7565.06
 * 4			44.12		821.14		6743.92
 * 5			39.33		825.93		5917.99
 * 6			34.52		830.74		5087.25
 * 7			29.67		835.59		4251.66
 * 8			24.8		840.46		3411.2
 * 9			19.89		845.37		2565.83
 * 10			14.96		850.3		1715.53
 * 11			10.0		855.26		860.27
 * 12			5.01		860.25		0.01
