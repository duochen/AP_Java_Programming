/**
 * (Game: bean machine) The bean machine, also known as a quincunx or the Galton
 * box, is a device for statistics experiments named after English scientist Sir
 * Francis Galton. It consists of an upright board with evenly spaced nails (or pegs)
 * in a triangular form, as shown in Figure 7.13.
 *
 * Balls are dropped from the opening of the board. Every time a ball hits a nail, it
 * has a 50% chance of falling to the left or to the right. The piles of balls are accumulated
 * in the slots at the bottom of the board.
 * Write a program that simulates the bean machine. Your program should prompt the
 * user to enter the number of the balls and the number of the slots in the machine.
 * Simulate the falling of each ball by printing its path. For example, the path for
 * the ball in Figure 7.13b is LLRRLLR and the path for the ball in Figure 7.13c is
 * RLRRLRR. Display the final buildup of the balls in the slots in a histogram. Here
 * is a sample run of the program:
 * (Hint: Create an array named slots. Each element in slots stores the number
 * of balls in a slot. Each ball falls into a slot via a path. The number of Rs in a path
 * is the position of the slot where the ball falls. For example, for the path LRLRLRR,
 * the ball falls into slots[4], and for the path RRLLLLL, the ball falls into
 * slots[2].)
 *
 * Enter the number of balls to drop: 5
 * Enter the number of slots in the bean machine: 8
 * LRLRLRR
 * RRLLLRR
 * LLRLLRR
 * RRLLLLL
 * LRLRRLR
