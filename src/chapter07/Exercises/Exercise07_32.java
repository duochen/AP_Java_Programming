/**
 * (Partition of a list) Write the following method that partitions the list using the
 * first element, called a pivot:
 * public static int partition(int[] list)
 * After the partition, the elements in the list are rearranged so all the elements before
 * the pivot are less than or equal to the pivot, and the elements after the pivot are
 * greater than the pivot. The method returns the index where the pivot is located in
 * the new list. For example, suppose the list is {5, 2, 9, 3, 6, 8}. After the partition,
 * the list becomes {3, 2, 5, 9, 6, 8}. Implement the method in a way that takes at
 * most list.length comparisons. See liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/dsanimation/
 * QuickSortNeweBook.html for an animation of the implementation. Write a
 * test program that prompts the user to enter the size of the list and the contents of
 * the list and displays the list after the partition. Here is a sample run.
 *
 * Enter list size: 8
 * Enter list content: 10 1 5 16 61 9 11 1
 * After the partition, the list is 9 1 5 1 10 61 11 16
