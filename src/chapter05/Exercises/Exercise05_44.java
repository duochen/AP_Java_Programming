/**
 * (Computer architecture: bit-level operations) A byte value is stored in 8 bits. Write
 * a program that prompts the user to enter a byte integer and displays the 8 bits for
 * the integer. Here are sample runs:
 *
 * Enter an integer: 5
 * The 8 bits are 00000101
 *
 * Enter an integer: â€“5
 * The 8 bits are 11111011
 *
 * (Hint: You need to use the bitwise right shift operator (>>) and the bitwise AND
 * operator (&), which are covered in Appendix G, Bitwise Operations.)
