/**
 * (Count occurrence of numbers) Write a program that reads the integers between
 * 1 and 50 and counts the occurrences of each. Assume the input ends with 0. Here
 * is a sample run of the program:
 * Enter the integers between 1 and 50: 2 5 6 5 4 3 23 43 2 0
 * 2 occurs 2 times
 * 3 occurs 1 time
 * 4 occurs 1 time
 * 5 occurs 2 times
 * 6 occurs 1 time
 * 23 occurs 1 time
 * 43 occurs 1 time
