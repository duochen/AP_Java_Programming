/**
 * (Assign grades) Write a program that reads student scores, gets the best score, and
 * then assigns grades based on the following scheme:
 * Grade is A if score is Ú best -5
 * Grade is B if score is Ú best -10;
 * Grade is C if score is Ú best -15;
 * Grade is D if score is Ú best -20;
 * Grade is F otherwise.
 * The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, and then
 * prompts the user to enter all of the scores, and concludes by displaying the grades.
 * Here is a sample run:
 * Enter the number of students: 4
 * Enter 4 scores: 40 55 70 58
 * Student 0 score is 40 and grade is F
 * Student 1 score is 55 and grade is C
 * Student 2 score is 70 and grade is A
 * Student 3 score is 58 and grade is C
