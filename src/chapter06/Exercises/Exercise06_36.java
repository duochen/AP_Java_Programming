/**
 * (Geometry: area of a regular polygon) A regular polygon is an n-sided polygon
 * in which all sides are of the same length and all angles have the same degree (i.e.,
 * the polygon is both equilateral and equiangular). The formula for computing the
 * area of a regular polygon is
 * Area = (n x s^2) / (4 x tan(Pi / n))
 * Write a method that returns the area of a regular polygon using the following header:
 * public static double area(int n, double side)
 * Write a main method that prompts the user to enter the number of sides and the
 * side of a regular polygon and displays its area. Here is a sample run:
 * Enter the number of sides: 5
 * Enter the side: 6.5
 * The area of the polygon is 72.69017017488385
