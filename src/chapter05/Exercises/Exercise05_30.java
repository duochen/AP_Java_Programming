/**
 * (Financial application: compound value) Suppose you save $100 each month
 * in a savings account with annual interest rate 3.75%. The monthly interest rate
 * is 0.0375 / 12 = 0.003125. After the first month, the value in the account
 * becomes
 * 100 * (1 + 0.003125) = 100.3125
 * After the second month, the value in the account becomes
 * 100 + 100.3125) * (1 + 0.003125) = 200.938
 * After the third month, the value in the account becomes
 * (100 + 200.938) * (1 + 0.003125) = 301.878
 * and so on.
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter an amount (e.g., 100), the annual
 * interest rate (e.g., 3.75), and the number of months (e.g., 6) and displays the
 * amount in the savings account after the given month.
