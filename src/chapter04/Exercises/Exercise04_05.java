/**
 * (Geometry: area of a regular polygon) A regular polygon is an n-sided polygon in
 * which all sides are of the same length and all angles have the same degree (i.e., the
 * polygon is both equilateral and equiangular). The formula for computing the area
 * of a regular polygon is
 * Area = (n * s^2) / (4 * tan(PI / n))
 * Here, s is the length of a side. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
 * number of sides and their length of a regular polygon and displays its area.
 *
 * Here is a sample run:
 * Enter the number of sides: 5
 * Enter the side: 6.5
 * The area of the polygon is 72.69017017488385
